# laura-coin-game
A simple coin game implemented using the JavaScript HTML gaming framework phaser.io

Drawn from an excellent tutorial, I coded this HTML5/JavaScript game in 2018.  

Directions to play:  Use the spacebar to jump + the arrow keys to direct the little gamer.  Gather all the coins + the red badge to win! Avoid drinking too much poison or you might lose.  Good luck!
